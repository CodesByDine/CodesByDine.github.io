# Geraldine Porfolio

Welcome to my algorithm! I have created a website portfolio displaying all my information as a software developer.



## Appendix

I am a young female software developer with a passion for creating, designing
and maintaining software. I enjoy growing my skills and learning new skills 
along the way. I wanted this portfolio to give users and inside to look into
my work and what I have to offer. There are still many more great things that I am
yet to accomplish.
